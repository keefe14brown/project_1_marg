RACE TO SUCCESS is a money earning financial game. Its a one on one game, where both players Earn income through their designated professions, 
racing to the goal of $1,000,000!  the players, have the ability to sabotage each other's business, hurting their income,
and run merchandise sales, to speed up the earning process.  You play as the character Billy Ray Valentine, and you must beat Louis Winthorpe, to 1million dollars
in order to win the home and all the money.

The game is loosely influenced by the classic holiday film "Trading Places".  The character names and style, is a form of homage to the film.
The end goal is to create a fully functional game with the ability to buy different items, and expand business. Eventually the game will have new levels, with new goals,
and new ways to earn/lose money.  This game will eventually be a deeplyn layered game, with countless ways to win, and an array of things you can do to make the process
more personalized and exciting with each play.

The game was built with html, css, and javascript.  I still have some issues to remedy.  the audio file would not work in the browser no matter what i tried.
The same was true for the video files.  The buttons, are constantly active, and need to be set as non functioning, until the start game process is completed.
the buy button options need to be updated. my script needs to be refined quite a lot.
